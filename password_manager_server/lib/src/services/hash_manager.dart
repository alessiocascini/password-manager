/// Utility class that provides helpers for generating a cryptographically
/// secure random salt and computing a SHA-256 digest for a given plaintext
/// concatenated with that salt.
///
/// **Important security note:** SHA-256 is a fast cryptographic hash and **is
/// not suitable** by itself for hashing user passwords (it is susceptible to
/// brute-force attacks). For password storage prefer a slow, memory-hard
/// algorithm such as Argon2, bcrypt or scrypt (or use a KDF like PBKDF2 with
/// appropriate parameters). Use the `hash` method below only for non-password
/// hashing purposes (e.g. integrity checks, keyed HMAC inputs when combined
/// with a secret, or as part of a stronger KDF).

  // Private constructor to prevent instantiation â€” this class exposes only
  // static helper methods and should not be constructed.

  /// Computes the SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of [plain] and [salt].
  ///
  /// [plain]: The input plaintext to be hashed.
  /// [salt]:  A salt value (typically random) that is appended to the
  ///          plaintext before hashing to provide uniqueness.
  ///
  /// Returns the hexadecimal representation of the SHA-256 digest.
  ///
  /// Note: This method is synchronous and returns a string suitable for
  /// storage or comparison. For password storage, prefer a dedicated
  /// password-hashing function (Argon2 / bcrypt / scrypt) rather than a raw
  /// SHA-256 digest.

  /// Implementation notes:
  /// - Uses [Random.secure()] as the source of randomness where available.
